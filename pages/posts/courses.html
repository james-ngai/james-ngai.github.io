                  15-210: Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms
                </h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I actually enjoyed that this course discussed the practical
                    elements of computation such as granularity control and more
                    systems level topics.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I also found the course's emphasis on developing parallel
                    algorithms to be an interesting departure from purely
                    sequential algorithms.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I found the topics discussed actually important and quite
                    fundamental knowledge a CS student should know.
                  </li>
                  <li>At times, the problems are straight Leetcode.</li>
                  <li>
                    The TAs and professors (Sleator and Acar) were not always on
                    the same page which meant the tests did not always meet
                    students' expectations.
                  </li>

                <h5>15-259: Probability and Computing</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The course material is very well prepared and makes learning
                    probability really easy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mor and Weina finalized a textbook, which used to be course
                    notes, and the book is absolutely all you need to succeed in
                    this course.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Compared to 21-325 version, this class is more applicable as
                    for example, PnC does not discuss Sigma fields. I actually
                    quite enjoyed this approach and saw its applications in
                    computing to be interesting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Overall, the lectures were very clear, and the course was
                    super well run overall.

                  <li>
                    I was really excited to dive into the world of SAT solvers
                    and decide the satisfiability of problems, and I think this
                    course made me realize while useful and powerful, I won't
                    take further classes in this domain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Overall, I found the topics to be less interesting than I
                    expected as lots of effort was focused on transformations
                    and proofs I didn't quite see the beauty in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Marijn and Jeremy were really great and clearly cared about
                    the course a lot.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    My favorite parts of the class were encoding problems into
                    SAT/SMT solvers, and having the SoTA solvers make light work
                    of them. These assignments made me appreciate the
                    applicability of such technologies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I really liked seeing an actual example of software
                    verification.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I originally took this course to take care of a science
                    requirement with the lowest FCE, but I actually learned
                    quite a bit!

                  <li>
                    I found the course to be a needed change up in my schedule
                    by physically building circuits as opposed to just math+CS
                    work.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The course staff and Tom Zajdel were absolutely amazing and
                    really supportive! Being surrounded by software people all
                    the time, it was nice to learn about people approaching
                    computers from a lower level.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For the Final Hack, there were quite a few really cool

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I actually enjoyed the first few weeks of course a lot and
                    found all the topics to be beautiful abstractions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At some point, I became lost by the loads of terminology in
                    the course (there's a lot) and found myself unable to keep
                    up without significant correction.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While I do find the topics interesting, I wouldn't take it
                    expecting ~10 hours of work a week with Bukh teaching it
                    unless you already have a pre-existing background in
                    abstract algebra.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This course demands a considerable amount of time. I
                    recommend the graduate version only if you can form a
                    cohesive group, possess prior experience, and are
                    self-sufficient in managing the coursework.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Although labeled as "practical," the lectures, quizzes, and
                    HW P1s effectively cover theoretical aspects. Expect to
                    dedicate significant time to weekend quizzes, which I found
                    challenging. Attending hackathons or collaborating with a
                    group can significantly aid in tackling these quizzes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be prepared to spend significant time on quizzes on
                    weekends. I found the quizzes to be quite challenging, but
                    attending the hackathons, or having a group to work with can
                    help immensely.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    HW P2s are engaging during implementation. However,
                    achieving the high cutoff requires delving into papers or
                    seeking architecture hints from TAs, followed by
                    experimenting with various configurations. This
                    experimentation can be somewhat tedious.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The final project offers a great opportunity for
                    exploration, but choose a feasible topic within the
                    one-month timeframe to avoid a hectic final week. The
                    mentorship quality varies, so being adept at finding online
                    resources can be crucial.

                  <li>
                    The TAs were incredibly knowledgeable and supportive. They
                    were also the most enthusiastic TAs I've encountered in any
                    class I've taken.

                    To do well in this class and save hours of pain, simply
                    planning out your design should be sufficent. If this
                    doesn't get you 100% of the way there, adding invariants to
                    your code will do so.

                    The class starts about a bit slow, but I found the ideas to
                    be more engaging come the end of the semester.

                  <li>
                    On some occasions, the problem sets could be quite
                    challenging and would require using arguments that are far
                    from straightforward.

                  <li>
                    The instructors teaching this semester were good, but be
                    wary the quality of any math class highly depends on the
                    professors unlike CS classes.

                    This class is well organized with good coordination between

                    The course has fair grading, and performance on tests is

                    significantly. Talking with peers in the other section, the
                    CS version covers far more content and is far superior. I
                    hope this issue is addressed and that both classes have the

                    Since I took Linear Algebra in High School, the first half
                    of this course was mostly review. Towards the end of the
                    class, there was a much higher focus on applications which
                    was interesting to learn.

                  <li>
                    The class has a final project which gives the opportunity to
                    further explore a linear algebra topic of your choice. I
                    found this aspect to be the most enjoyable of the class.
